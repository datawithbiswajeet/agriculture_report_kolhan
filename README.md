## 💡 Project Motivation

This project was inspired by a job post for an **Agriculture Data Analyst**. It highlighted the **lack of real-time analytics and visual tools** for state-level agriculture insights — especially in regions like Jharkhand.

With better access to clean, structured government data, we can empower:

- 📌 Policy Makers  
- 📈 Planning Departments  
- 🌿 NGOs and AgriTech Firms  
- 🧑‍🌾 Local Farming Communities
